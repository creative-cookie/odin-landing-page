# Basic Landing Page

## Overview
This basic landing page was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It utilizes the HTML and CSS knowledge gained from the course so far.

## Features
The website features a basic landing page that utilizes Flexbox for its layout. Please note that it is not responsive.

## What I Learned
While I was able to achieve the desired layout fairly easily, I wasn't satisfied with the organization I originally had in both the HTML and CSS files. As such, I researched ways that I could refactor the code to make it more manageable and organized. I learned about more efficient and organized approaches that included using custom properties, utility classes, and BEM. I then refactored my code to implement what I learned.
